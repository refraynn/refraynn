# Hey there! I'm Ray.
Hey! I'm Ray (refraynn), a game designer, software engineer, and general 3D artist. I don't use GitHub as much as I should, probably.

## Programming
Programming was one of my first forays into the technical field. While I have since moved most of my work to the creative industry, I still work on projects from the technical side from time to time. 
If you're interested, here are some of my most recent projects:
- [Crimson](https://github.com/refraynn/Crimson)
- [Surge](https://github.com/Harmony-Software/surge)

Most of my projects have been lost to time‚Äîmore work will be uploaded here as time goes on.

## Visual Art
I've been a 3D artist in different forms for several years now. I've taken courses, both in-person and online, at various institutions. I also do graphic design and other visual arts.
*Most* of my art will be uploaded to my [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/refraynn.bsky.social), but I am also working on creating a portfolio website to hopefully replace this README.
I also did all of the graphics and logos for [Harmony Software](https://github.com/Harmony-Software).

## Odd Jobs
Outside of these main projects, I have also done work for both myself and others over the years. Here are a few:

This information is likely incomplete, since most of my career has not been shared publicly. To solve this, I will likely be purchasing my own domain to host my portfolio in its entirety, whether it is technical projects that link to repositories or any art that I do. I'll make sure to update this page with redirect to that site if that happens. Thank you!
